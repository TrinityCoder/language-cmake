## __9/9/2020:__ Original [`lucas-clemente/language-cmake`](https://github.com/lucas-clemente/language-cmake) repository discontinued?
The original [lucas-clemente/language-cmake](https://github.com/lucas-clemente/language-cmake) repository has been archived. Because it's maintainer has [already told](https://github.com/lucas-clemente/language-cmake/pull/23#issuecomment-493762702) that he does not use Atom editor anymore and the last commit is [my merged pull request](https://github.com/lucas-clemente/language-cmake/pull/24) from more than a year ago (version 1.2.0), _the project seems discontinued to me_.

A couple of days ago, I made [another pull request (#25)](https://github.com/lucas-clemente/language-cmake/pull/25), once again updating the list of keywords based on the changes in [CMake](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/v3.18/) over the past year. It's possible that this new pull request will never be merged. So I decided to use my forked repository [TrinityCoder/language-cmake](https://github.com/TrinityCoder/language-cmake), more specifically the `devel` branch (newly set as default), to provide my current up-to-date version of the `language-cmake` package. I don't have access to the official repo nor to the [Atom.io language-cmake package administration](https://atom.io/packages/language-cmake).

### How to install this version of `language-cmake` into Atom?
_Coming soon..._
